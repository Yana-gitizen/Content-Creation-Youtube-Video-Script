You can also find a sample of my Research based writing skills on any of the News Sites that have my bylines:

My Writing Style incorporates the key points:
-Start with finding an engaging topic or make a topic engaging by creating a catchy opening hook.
-Describe a short but compelling setting to draw the readers into the piece- as if its a world of its own.
-Organize by time line of events or connect the story by chronology or logical sequencing.
-Back up fictional sidelines with authentic Figures, facts and data to make the piece more significant.
-Stay true to my style- fully humanized content no AI.
-End with a message/lesson/question. Either solving the plot for ultimate reader satisfaction or Sometimes leaving the reader grasping for sequels.
